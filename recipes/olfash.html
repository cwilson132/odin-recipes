  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The old fashioned is a cocktail made by muddling sugar with bitters and water, adding whiskey, and garnishing with orange slice or zest and a cocktail cherry. It is traditionally served in an old fashioned glass, which predated the cocktail.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bourbon of your choice</li>
      <li>1 orange for the peel</li>
      <li>Angostura bitters</li>
      <li>A sugar cube or simple syrup</li>
      <li>A single large piece of ice</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>In your whiskey glass, add your sugar cube and 3-6 dashes of the angostura bitters.</ol>
    <ol>Muddle until the sugar and bitters until the cube has been broken down.</ol>
    <ol>Add your ice and 2-3 ounces of bourbon.</ol>
    <ol>Stir for 25-30 seconds or until your desired dilution is reached.</ol>
    <ol>Using a peeler, peel off a piece of the orange peel that is around 3 inches long.</ol>
    <ol>Squeeze the peel over the glass to express the oils.</ol>
    <ol>wipe the peel along the rim of the glass then garnish the drink with the peel.</ol>
    <ol>All that's left to do now is sit back and enoy your Old Fashioned.</ol>
