  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy to make, delicious, high protein chicken and dumpling soup made with gnocchi.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chickne breast</li>
      <li>1 can cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>1 packet of powdered chicken gravy mix</li>
      <li>2 cups of chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 package of gnocchi</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Trim excess fat from chicken breast and dice if you like. I prefer to leave it whole for now. Then, place in a crockpot.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, add your chicken broth, gravy packet and cream of chicken soup, and mix until the gravy powder has combined well with the liquid ingredients.</li>
      <li>Once you have everything mixed together, add it to the crockpot with the chicken breast and cook on high 4-6 hours.</li>
      <li>In the meantime, you'll want to prepare the gnocchi as per the instrutions on the package and set aside.</li>
      <li>After the chicken has finished cooking, separate it from the liquid in the crockpot and dice or shred if you haven't already.</li>
      <li>Portion out your gnocchi and chicken depending on how many servings you want.</li>
      <li>Add as much of the left over liquid from the crockpot as you desire to each container.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your delicious meal prep chicken and gnocchi soup.</li>
    </ol>
